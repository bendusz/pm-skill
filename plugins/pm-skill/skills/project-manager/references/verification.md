# Verification

The final, independent check that a story is genuinely shippable — **after** the deterministic gates
and the reviewer/fix loop, **before** ship/merge. Run by the `pm-verifier` subagent. **No external
harness and no separate lifecycle process** — just a read-only Claude Code subagent the PM
dispatches.

## When
In the per-story loop: build → gate → review → fix → **verify** → ship → log. Enter verification only
once the gates are green and no `block`/`major` review findings remain open.

## Inputs to the verifier
- The story file (goal, `Covers:` IDs, acceptance criteria, verification command).
- `docs/spec.md` / `docs/plan.md` — the requirements the story must satisfy.
- The diff **text** and the list of changed paths.
- The reviewer verdicts and the gate results you already ran.

## Expected report
`pm-verifier` returns `STATUS: PASS | FAIL | UNKNOWN`, with confidence, per-criterion and per-gate
results, review-finding resolution, open issues, and an action. It treats builder/PM summaries as
**claims** and checks them against real repo state (it has read-only Bash for `git`/gates/grep).

## Handling the verdict
- **PASS** — required before ship. Proceed to commit/merge.
- **FAIL** — back to the **fix loop** (builder; dispatch `debugger` first if a gate is the cause),
  within the same **≤3-round** bound, then re-verify. **Never ship a FAIL.**
- **UNKNOWN** — gather the **exact missing evidence** the verifier named (a command it couldn't run,
  an artifact it lacked) and re-verify; if it can't be obtained, **escalate to the user**. Never treat
  UNKNOWN as PASS.

## Where evidence lives
- Lightweight / single-story work: a quick **inline** verifier pass is enough — `STATUS` still
  required, but you may skip the durable report and checklists and just summarise the result in
  `pm/log.md`.
- Non-trivial projects (recommended): write a durable `docs/verification/<story-id>.md` from
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/verification-report.md.template`.
- Optionally tick `docs/checklists/verification-<id>.md` from the verification-quality template.
- Set `current_story_verification_status` in `pm/actors/<you>.json`.

A story is **done** only with `pm-verifier` `PASS` (see `review-gates.md`).
