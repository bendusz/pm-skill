description: Resolve open [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] questions in docs/spec.md — one at a time, up to five — before planning.
---

Use the `project-manager` skill to resolve ambiguity in `docs/spec.md` before planning.

Focus: $ARGUMENTS

Rules:
- Read `docs/spec.md`. Find the highest-impact unknowns — `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` markers first,
  then any vague requirement, acceptance criterion, or success metric.
- Ask **one question at a time** and wait for the answer before the next. Ask **at most 5** this
  session — spend them on what most changes the build.
- For each question give: the question; **2–3** realistic options; a **recommended** option; and one
  line on **why it matters**.
- After each answer, update `docs/spec.md` **immediately** — record the decision in the right section
  (a requirement, an acceptance criterion, an assumption, or the Clarifications log) and remove the
  matching `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker.
- Stop when the markers are resolved, the user is out of answers, or you have asked 5. Do **not** start
  planning, decomposition, or implementation.

End with a short summary of what was resolved and what (if anything) still blocks planning.
