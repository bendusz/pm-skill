# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## 0.9.2 — 2026-07-07

Explicit model + effort pinning for every agent.

- **All nine agents ship pinned** — no agent uses `model: inherit` anymore; behaviour no longer
  depends on the session model. `expert-builder` is pinned to `fable` (top tier); the other eight
  are pinned to `opus`.
- **Reasoning effort set per agent** — new `effort:` frontmatter on every agent:
  `security-auditor` and `debugger` run at `high`; all other agents at `medium`.
- **Docs updated** — `references/model-tiering.md` rewritten around the new pinned mapping and the
  `effort:` override; the SKILL.md tiering summary matches.

## 0.9.1 — 2026-07-05

Agent-quality pass, driven by verified community/official best-practice research (Anthropic
subagent docs and engineering posts; wshobson/agents and VoltAgent conventions).

- **Trigger-condition descriptions** — every agent's `description` now states *when* to use it
  (concrete activation conditions, `PROACTIVELY` where standalone use is safe), not just what it
  is, making delegation reliable inside and outside the PM loop.
- **Explicit completion criteria** — every agent now defines what *done* means; `pm-verifier`
  gains the early-victory rule (MUST run the verification command and every runnable non-mutating
  gate itself before PASS), and builder/test-engineer must run what they wrote before reporting.
- **Reviewer calibration** — the three review lenses gain a shared approach/calibration block
  (diff-first evidence, named-risk-only exploration, honest severity, no invented findings).
- **Model tiering on by default for routine roles** — `debugger`, `test-engineer`,
  `technical-writer`, `codebase-analyst` ship pinned to `sonnet`; the five quality-critical agents
  keep `model: inherit`. `references/model-tiering.md` rewritten around the shipped defaults.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-07-05

Multi-actor PM state: several people can run concurrent PM sessions on one repo without
overwriting each other. Solo is a team of one — same layout, no mode switch.
(Design: `docs/specs/2026-07-05-v0.9-multi-actor-state.md`.)

- **Shared core + per-actor state** — `pm/pm-state.json` slims to project facts plus an
  `assignments` claims map; each person's position (story, branch, loop counters, next, handoff
  freshness) lives in `pm/actors/<id>.json`, identity derived from git `user.email`/`user.name`.
- **Shared append-only log** — author-prefixed entries, `merge=union` gitattribute (bootstrap
  writes it) so concurrent appends merge cleanly; the mutable Current State block is removed.
- **Per-actor handoffs** — `/pm-skill:handoff` writes `pm/actors/<id>.HANDOFF.md`; staleness is
  checked against the actor file.
- **Claim & sync discipline** — pull before claim/ship, claims committed on the integration
  branch (pushed only under the user's standing push permission), re-gate if
  the integration tip moved, claims released in the ship commit; `/pm-skill:doctor` and
  `/pm-skill:analyze` flag double-claims, stale claims, and cross-actor `Touches` overlap.
- **`actor-guard.sh`** — new fail-open hook blocking writes to another actor's state files; the
  session hook now shows your position plus teammates' one-liners.
- **Migration** — flat 0.8 layouts split into shared + actor files on resume (log block stripped,
  gitattribute added); pre-0.8 `tmp/` layouts chain through in one pass.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-05

Durable, git-tracked session state: the PM state files move from gitignored `tmp/` to a tracked
`pm/` directory.

- **Tracked `pm/` state directory** — `pm/pm-state.json`, `pm/log.md`, and the optional
  `pm/HANDOFF.md` replace `tmp/pm-state.json` / `tmp/log.md`. The state trio is the
  project's only durable resume point, so it now lives in git and travels with every clone/push;
  state updates are committed alongside the work they describe (e.g. with each story's ship/log
  commit). Bootstrap verifies the state files are not gitignored (`git check-ignore
  pm/pm-state.json pm/log.md` — the files, not the directory, so `pm/*`-style rules are caught)
  and commits `pm/` from the first state write.
- **`/pm-skill:handoff`** — end a session by writing `pm/HANDOFF.md` (from the new
  `HANDOFF.md.template`): a token-efficient, agent-to-agent briefing — position, in-flight story
  state, gate results, open findings, decisions not yet in docs, gotchas, `READ_FIRST`/`SKIP`
  pointers, ordered next steps. `/pm-skill:resume` reads it (after `pm-state.json`) when current;
  staleness is a JSON check — the new `handoff_written` state field vs `updated`. A worked
  handoff example ships in `examples/todo-cli/pm/`.
- **Session re-grounding hook** — a new `SessionStart` hook (`hooks/session-context.sh`) injects a
  short pm/-state pointer (phase, story, next step, handoff freshness) into every new, resumed,
  cleared, or **freshly-compacted** session of a PM-managed project; silent everywhere else. The
  PM also offers `/pm-skill:handoff` at sprint checkpoints and when context runs long.
- **Secrets guard hook** — a new `PreToolUse` hook (`hooks/pm-secrets-guard.sh`) blocks writes into
  the tracked `pm/` directory whose content matches high-confidence secret shapes (AWS/GitHub/
  Slack/API tokens, PEM private keys, JWTs, quoted credential assignments). Fail-open, same
  `PM_SKILL_NO_ENFORCE=1` kill switch; a tripwire for accidents, not a scanner.
- **Loop bounds survive resume** — new `current_story_rounds` / `current_story_retries` state
  fields persist the ≤3 fix-round / ≤2 builder-retry caps across sessions (parallel-path batch
  entries carry the same counters), so a resumed session can no longer silently reset the bounds.
- **`/pm-skill:correct-course`** — the sanctioned path for mid-flight scope changes: checkpoint the
  in-flight story, apply the change at the right altitude (spec / plan / story), void sign-off if
  the change is material (`signed_off: false` re-engages the hook), reset the story's counters,
  log and commit.
- **`/pm-skill:doctor` checks PM-state health** — state JSON parses, `pm/` not gitignored, `tmp/`
  ignored, log/state/plan sign-off agreement, and handoff freshness.
- **CI hardening** — the validate workflow now also runs `shellcheck` over all hooks and scripts;
  `validate.sh` checks every bundled hook is executable.
- **`tmp/` stays scratch and gitignored** — prompts, raw subagent/review output, diffs,
  `tmp/environment-check.md`, `tmp/worktrees/`, one-off scripts. Nothing in `tmp/` may be
  load-bearing for resume.
- **No-secrets rule (now load-bearing)** — `pm/` is tracked, so secrets/credentials must never be
  written into the state files; reference secret locations, never values.
- **Migration** — on `/pm-skill:resume` (or any state read), a pre-0.8 project with state still
  under `tmp/` is migrated: files move to `pm/`, one-line pointer stubs are left in `tmp/`, repo
  references are updated, and the result is committed. The sign-off hook reads
  `pm/pm-state.json` and falls back to `tmp/pm-state.json` for not-yet-migrated projects; its
  pre-sign-off allowlist now includes `pm/*`.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-06-06

Mechanical rigor and right-sizing on top of the spec-driven workflow.

- **EARS acceptance criteria** — `spec.md.template` now models behavioural criteria as
  `WHEN <event>, THE SYSTEM SHALL <behaviour>` (plain measurable statements for non-event criteria),
  making them directly testable for `test-engineer` and `pm-verifier`.
- **`/pm-skill:checklist`** — generate (and optionally evaluate, with evidence) the spec / plan /
  story / verification quality checklists under `docs/checklists/`.
- **`/pm-skill:doctor`** — a read-mostly environment-readiness probe (toolchain, lockfiles, and
  whether the gates actually run) → `tmp/environment-check.md`, run before the implementation loop.
- **Scale profiles** (`references/scale-profiles.md`) — `tiny`→`regulated` right-size the workflow;
  scaling down drops artifacts/ceremony but never the hard rules. `pm-state.json` gains `scale`;
  `plan.md` gains a Delivery mode section.
- **Story risk/lens metadata** — stories declare `Risk` and `Review lenses` (+ `Security-sensitive` /
  `Architecture-sensitive`), so `/pm-skill:analyze` checks declared-vs-actual instead of guessing.
- **Optional hardening** (`references/hardening.md` + `claude-settings-hardening.json.template`) — a
  Claude Code-native hook that scopes a read-only Bash allowlist to the `pm-verifier` subagent (via the
  `agent_type` hook input), leaving the PM unaffected; the verifier's read-only Bash is otherwise a
  behavioural rule, not a sandbox.
- **Validation** — `scripts/validate.sh` now also checks reference integrity (SKILL references,
  template references, command frontmatter), parses the JSON templates, and verifies the CHANGELOG top
  matches the plugin version.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-06-06

Spec-driven planning, traceability, and an independent final verification step — all Claude
Code-native and self-contained (no external dependency).

- **New commands:** `/pm-skill:specify` (durable `docs/spec.md`), `/pm-skill:clarify` (resolve
  `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`, ≤5 questions), `/pm-skill:constitution` (project rules), `/pm-skill:analyze`
  (read-only cross-artifact consistency report).
- **New agent:** `pm-verifier` — read-only final `PASS`/`FAIL`/`UNKNOWN` gate; a story can't ship
  without PASS.
- **New references:** `specification.md`, `verification.md`, `artifact-consistency.md`.
- **Traceability:** stable spec IDs (`US-`/`FR-`/`AC-`/`SM-`), a story `Covers:` field, and a plan
  `covers` column + Traceability table.
- **New templates:** spec, constitution, verification-report, and four quality checklists.
- Workflow is now discover → specify → clarify → plan → sign-off → analyze → decompose → build → gate
  → review → fix → verify → ship → log. `pm-state.json` gains `spec`, `constitution`,
  `last_analysis_status`, and `current_story_verification_status`.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-06-04

Parallel `[P]` story execution via git worktrees — opt-in, best-effort, with a hard fallback to the
sequential loop.

- New `references/parallel-execution.md`: build independent `[P]` stories at once in isolated git
  worktrees, then integrate them **one at a time** (concurrent build, serialized integration — the
  model behind merge queues / merge trains / the "Not Rocket Science Rule").
- Safe because builders make no commits (the PM owns git): the concurrent phase does zero git writes,
  so there's no shared-`.git` contention. Before each land, the latest integration tip is merged in
  and the full gates re-run — catching semantic conflicts two "independent" stories can create.
- Decomposition records each story's **Touches** (files/modules); `[P]` + non-overlapping Touches
  selects the batch. Default fan-out 3 (configurable). `tmp/worktrees/` (gitignored); native
  worktree isolation preferred when the host offers it.
- Worktree safety: never `rm -rf`, never force-remove a dirty worktree, no orphans (prune on
  resume). `pm-state.json` gains a `parallel_batch` array for resume. Same gates/review panel as
  sequential.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-06-04

More delivery agents and optional model tiering. All additive — defaults unchanged.

- New bundled agents: `security-auditor` (read-only deep security lens, risk-selected),
  `technical-writer` (docs only — README, usage, CHANGELOG, completion report), and `debugger`
  (read-only root-cause diagnosis → fix plan the builder applies).
- `security-auditor` is now a first-class risk-triggered lens in the review panel
  (`review-gates.md`); `debugger` joins the fix loop when a gate fails or it stalls; an optional
  Document step adds `technical-writer` at the sprint/project boundary.
- **Optional model tiering** (`references/model-tiering.md`) — map agents to cheaper/stronger models
  by abstract tier (deep / standard / light). Off by default; every agent still inherits the session
  model and no vendor model IDs are hardcoded.
- New `completion-report.md.template`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-06-04

Hardening: enforcement, recoverable state, CI, and a worked example.

- **Sign-off enforcement hook** (`hooks/`) — a fail-open `PreToolUse` hook that blocks implementation
  writes until `tmp/pm-state.json` has `signed_off: true`. Inert outside a PM project; kill switch
  `PM_SKILL_NO_ENFORCE=1`.
- **Structured state + resume** — `tmp/pm-state.json` and the `/pm-skill:resume` command.
- **Story-readiness check** before build, and **reviewer-finding triage** before the fix loop.
- **Worked example** under `examples/todo-cli/`.
- **CI + OSS hygiene** — `scripts/validate.sh`, a validate workflow, CONTRIBUTING, and issue/PR templates.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-04

Delivery agents and risk-based review.

- New bundled agents: `codebase-analyst` (read-only context pack), `test-engineer` (tests only),
  `architecture-reviewer` (read-only design lens).
- Review generalised into a risk-selected **panel** (`review-gates.md`): always run
  `code-integrity-reviewer`; add `architecture-reviewer` for structural changes.
- Planning gains an optional `codebase-analyst` analyze step for brownfield projects.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-02

Initial release.

- `project-manager` skill: discover → plan → sign-off → decompose → orchestrate → review → ship → log.
- Bundled agents: `expert-builder` (implementation) and `code-integrity-reviewer` (read-only review).
- `/pm-skill:pm` command entry.
- Target-project templates: `CLAUDE.md`, `plan.md`, `story.md`, `log.md`.
- Sprint-level checkpoints (configurable); `tmp/log.md` recovery; repository-safety rules.
